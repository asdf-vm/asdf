# Security Policy

**This security policy only applies to asdf core, which is the code contained in this repository. All plugins are the responsibility of their creators and are not covered under this security policy.** 

## Supported Versions

Typically only the latest version is maintained. Versions are
released sequentially, with major, minor, and patch versions incremented
as necessary. If a vulnerability is found in an old version of asdf,
updating to the latest version of asdf will be required.
