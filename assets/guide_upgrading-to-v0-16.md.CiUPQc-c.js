The &quot;global&quot; and &quot;local&quot; terminology was wrong and also misleading. asdf doesn&#39;t actually support &quot;global&quot; versions that apply everywhere. Any version that was specified with <code>asdf global</code> could easily be overridden by a <code>.tool-versions</code> file in your current directory specifying a different version. This was confusing to users. The new <code>asdf set</code> behaves the same as <code>asdf local</code> by default, but also has flags for setting versions in the user&#39;s home directory (<code>--home</code>) and in an existing <code>.tool-versions</code> file in one of the parent directories (<code>--parent</code>). This new interface will hopefully convey a better understanding of how asdf resolves versions and provide equivalent functionality.</p><h3 id="asdf-update-command-has-been-removed" tabindex="-1"><code>asdf update</code> command has been removed <a class="header-anchor" href="#asdf-update-command-has-been-removed" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;`asdf update` command has been removed&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Updates can no longer be performed this way.

It was able to do this because <code>asdf</code> was actually a shell function, not an executable. The new rewrite removes all shell code from asdf, and it is now a binary rather than a shell function, so setting environment variables directly in the shell is no longer possible.</p><h3 id="asdf-current-has-changed" tabindex="-1"><code>asdf current</code> has changed <a class="header-anchor" href="#asdf-current-has-changed" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;`asdf current` has changed&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Instead of three columns in the output, with the last being either the location the version is set or a suggested command that could be run to set or install a version.

This mean that scripts lacking a shebang could still be run by <code>asdf exec</code>. With asdf 0.16.x implemented in Go we now invoke executables via Go&#39;s <code>syscall.Exec</code> function, which cannot handle scripts lacking a shebang.</p><p>In practice this isn&#39;t much of a problem. Most shell scripts DO contain a shebang line. If a tool managed by asdf provides scripts that don&#39;t have a shebang line one will need to be added to them.</p><h3 id="custom-shim-templates-are-no-longer-supported" tabindex="-1">Custom shim templates are no longer supported <a class="header-anchor" href="#custom-shim-templates-are-no-longer-supported" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Custom shim templates are no longer supported&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This was a rarely used feature. The only plugin maintained by the core team that used it was the Elixir plugin, and it no longer needs it. This feature was originally added so that shim that get evaluated by a program rather than executed contain code that is suitable for evaluation by a particular program (in the case of Elixir this was the <code>iex</code> shell). Upon further investigation it seems this feature only exists because the <code>PATH</code> for executables was sometimes improperly set to include the <strong>shims</strong> rather than the other <strong>executables</strong> for the selected version(s).</p>',67)]))}const m=a(t,[["render",i]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
