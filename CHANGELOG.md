    ```shell

    pre_asdf_plugin_remove_foo = echo will remove plugin foo
    post_asdf_plugin_remove = echo removed plugin ${1}
    post_asdf_plugin_remove_foo = echo removed plugin foo
    ```

* Use different exit code if updates are disabled (#676)

Fixed Bugs

* Make sure extension commands are properly displayed by `asdf help`

  Extension commands are now expected to be inside plugins's `lib/commands/command-*.bash` instead of `bin/command*`.

  This change was made for two reasons: Keep the convention that all files to be sourced by bash should end with
  the `.bash` extension. And the `lib/commands/` directory mirrors the location of asdf own core commands.

  Added tests to make sure `asdf help` properly displays available extension commands.

* Remove automatic `compinit` from asdf.sh (#674, #678)

* Fix issue with preset version warning assuming that the shim name and plugin name are the same (#622)

## 0.7.6

Features

* Improve output format of `asdf plugin list all`

  Long plugin names were causing problems with how we used printf.
  Now we use the `column` command to properly render output.

* Now `asdf plugin list` can take both `--urls` and `--refs` options.

  When `--url` is used, we print the plugin's remote origin URL.
  While `--refs` prints the git branch/commit the plugin is at.

* It's now possible to update a plugin to an specific branch/commit.

  `asdf plugin update <name> [git-ref]`

  Checkouts a plugin to the specified `git-ref`. Defaults to `master`

* Now the `asdf plugin test` command can be specified with a plugin commit/branch to test.

  This will help CI checks to actually test the commit they are running for.
  Previously we always used the plugin's `master` branch.

* Subcommand CLI support.

   Users familiar with sub-command aware tools like `git` can now
   use `asdf` commands in the same way. For example:

   `asdf plugin list all` is equivalent to `asdf plugin-list-all`

   This is also the case for plugin extension commands, where the
   plugin name is an asdf main subcommand. ie. Having a `foo` plugin
   you can invoke: `asdf foo bar`

* Make `asdf plugin test` use the new `asdf latest` command. (#541)

   If a plugin version is not given explicitly, we use `asdf latest` to
   obtain the version of plugin to install for testing.

* `asdf --version` displays git revision when asdf_dir is a git clone.

   This will allow better bug reports since people can now include the
   git commit they are using.

* Add support for asdf extension commands.

   Plugins can provide `bin/command*` scripts or executables that will
   be callable using the asdf command line interface.

   See `docs/plugins-create.md` for more info.

* Add support for installing the latest stable version of a tool (#216)

    ```shell
    asdf install python latest
    asdf install python latest:3.7 # installs latest Python 3.7 version
    ```

* Add `asdf latest` command to display the latest stable version of a tool (#575)

    ```shell
    asdf latest python
    asdf latest python 3.7 # displays latest Python 3.7 version
    ```

* Add support for filtering versions returned by `asdf list-all`

    ```shell
    asdf list-all python 3.7 # lists available Python 3.7 versions
    ````

* New `asdf env <command>` can be used to print or execute with the env that would be used to execute a shim. (#435)
* Configurable command hooks from `.asdfrc` (#432, #434)
  Suppose a `foo` plugin is installed and provides a `bar` executable,
  The following hooks will be executed when set:

    ```shell
    pre_asdf_install_foo = echo will install foo version ${1}
    post_asdf_install_foo = echo installed foo version ${1}

    pre_asdf_reshim_foo = echo will reshim foo version ${1}
    post_asdf_reshim_foo = echo reshimmed foo version ${1}

    pre_foo_bar = echo about to execute command bar from foo with args: ${@}
    post_foo_bar = echo just executed command bar from foo with args: ${@}

    pre_asdf_uninstall_foo = echo will remove foo version ${1}
    post_asdf_uninstall_foo = echo removed foo version ${1}
    ```
* New shim version meta-data allows shims to not depend on a particular plugin
  nor on its relative executable path (#431)
  Upgrading requires shim re-generation and should happen automatically by `asdf-exec`:
  `rm -rf ~/.asdf/shims/` followed by `asdf reshim`
* Added lots of tests for shim execution.
  We now make sure that shim execution obeys plugins hooks like `list-bin-paths` and
  `exec-path`.
* Shims now are thin wrappers around `asdf exec` that might be faster
  for most common use case: (versions on local .tool-versions file) but fallbacks to
  slower `get_preset_version_for` which takes legacy formats into account.
* Shim exec recommends which plugins or versions to set when command is not found.
* `asdf reshim` without arguments now reshims all installed plugins (#407)
* Add `asdf shim-versions <executable>` to list on which plugins and versions is a command
  available. (#380, #433)
