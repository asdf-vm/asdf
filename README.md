**Manage multiple runtime versions with a single CLI tool, extendable via plugins** - [docs at asdf-vm.com](https://asdf-vm.github.io/asdf/)

asdf is a CLI tool that can manage multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis. It is like `gvm`, `nvm`, `rbenv` & `pyenv` (and more) all in one! Simply install your language's plugin!

## Why use asdf?

- single CLI for multiple languages
- consistent commands to manage all your languages
- single global config keeping defaults in one place
- single `.tool-versions` config file per project
- support for existing config files `.node-version`, `.nvmrc`, `.ruby-version` for easy migration
- automatically switches runtime versions as you traverse your directories
- simple plugin system to add support for your language of choice
- shell completion available for common shells (Bash, Zsh, Fish)
