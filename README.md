**Manage multiple runtime versions with a single CLI tool, extendable via plugins** - [docs at asdf-vm.com](https://asdf-vm.github.io/asdf/)

asdf is a CLI tool that can manage multiple language runtime versions on a per-project basis. It is like `gvm`, `nvm`, `rbenv` & `pyenv` (and more) all in one! Simply install your language's plugin!

## Why use asdf?

- single CLI for multiple languages
- consistent commands to manage all your languages
- single global config keeping defaults in one place
- single `.tool-versions` config file per project
- support for existing config files `.node-version`, `.nvmrc`, `.ruby-version` for easy migration
- automatically switches runtime versions as you traverse your directories
- simple plugin system to add support for your language of choice
- shell completion available for common shells (Bash, Zsh, Fish, Elvish)

## Ballad of asdf

> Once upon a time there was a programming language<br/>
> There were many versions of it<br/>
> So people wrote a version manager for it<br/>
> To switch between versions for projects<br/>
> Different, old, new.

> Then there came more programming languages<br/>
> So there came more version managers<br/>
> And many commands for them

> I installed a lot of them<br/>
> I learnt a lot of commands

> Then I said, just one more version manager<br/>
> Which I will write instead

> So, there came another version manager<br/>
> **asdf version manager** - <https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf>

> A version manager so extendable<br/>
> for which anyone can create a plugin<br/>
> To support their favourite language<br/>
> No more installing more version managers<br/>
> Or learning more commands
